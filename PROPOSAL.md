# LearnThaiAI - AI-Powered Language Learning Platform

## Product Proposal & Vision

> **Core Concept**: User-driven Thai language learning powered by AI where learners choose their topics, and the system dynamically generates contextual vocabulary with scientifically-proven spaced repetition for optimal retention.

---

## 🎯 **Executive Summary**

LearnThaiAI is a revolutionary web-based language learning platform that combines the power of GPT-4o artificial intelligence with proven spaced repetition science to create a personalized, context-driven Thai learning experience. Unlike traditional language apps that follow rigid curricula, LearnThaiAI puts learners in control by allowing them to generate vocabulary around topics they're actually interested in, while intelligently tracking their progress and optimizing review schedules.

**Key Innovation**: Instead of pre-made lessons, users input real-world topics (like "ordering food at a restaurant" or "talking about hobbies") and receive AI-generated vocabulary with natural example sentences, romanization, and translations—all tailored to avoid words they've already mastered.

## 🏗️ **Current MVP Implementation**

### **1. AI-Powered Vocabulary Generation**

- **Dynamic Topic Input**: Users enter any topic and receive 10 contextually relevant Thai words
- **GPT-4o Integration**: Natural language processing for authentic vocabulary generation
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Automatically excludes previously learned words
- **Comprehensive Word Data**: Each word includes:
  - Thai script
  - Romanization (Royal Thai system)
  - English translation
  - Natural example sentence in Thai
  - Romanized pronunciation of sentence
  - English translation of sentence

### **2. Scientific Spaced Repetition System**

- **SM-2 Algorithm**: Proven spaced repetition with personalized difficulty tracking
- **Smart Priority Scoring**: 0-100 point system considering:
  - Difficulty factor (ease of recall)
  - Learning efficiency (repetitions vs. time)
  - Status priority (new > learning > mastered)
  - Overdue bonus (forgotten words get priority)
  - Interval adjustment (recent reviews weighted higher)
- **Dual Review Modes**:
  - Smart Priority (difficulty-based)
  - Time-based (chronological due dates)
- **Visual Progress Tracking**: Star ratings, color coding, next review dates

### **3. AI-Powered Speaking Practice System**

- **Guided 4-Step Workflow**:
  1. **Vocabulary Selection**: Choose from your saved vocabulary words
  2. **Listen & Practice**: Hear correct pronunciation and select practice mode (word/sentence)
  3. **Record Pronunciation**: Record your attempt using browser microphone
  4. **AI Feedback Analysis**: Receive detailed feedback with audio comparison
- **OpenAI TTS Integration**: High-quality text-to-speech for reference pronunciation
- **Speech Recognition**: OpenAI Whisper (GPT-4o mini) transcription for pronunciation capture
- **AI Pronunciation Analysis**: GPT-4o analyzes pronunciation attempts and provides specific feedback
- **Smart Audio Caching**: Cost-optimized system that caches reference pronunciations (shared) but never caches user transcriptions (privacy)
- **Audio Comparison**: Side-by-side playback of user pronunciation vs. correct pronunciation using the same TTS voice for fair comparison
- **Practice Modes**: Choose between practicing individual words or complete example sentences
- **Progress Tracking**: Store pronunciation session data for analytics and improvement tracking

### **4. Bidirectional Translation Tool**

- **Session Statistics**: Review completion rates and performance metrics
- **Pronunciation Analytics**: Track speaking practice sessions and improvement over time
- **Historical Data**: Vocabulary generation, translation, and pronunciation practice history
- **Visual Difficulty Indicators**: 1-5 star system with color coding

### **6. Enterprise-Grade Security**

- **Supabase Authentication**: Email/password + magic link support
- **Row-Level Security**: Users can only access their own data
- **Audio Storage Security**: Separate buckets for cached TTS (shared) and user recordings (private)
- **Rate Limiting**: API protection against abuse (10 generations/hour, 30 translations/hour)
