- **Input Validation**: Assess Zod schema coverage and validation completeness
- **Response Standards**: Check error formatting and success response consistency
- **Documentation**: Evaluate API documentation and contract clarity

### 5. Performance & Scalability Assessment

- **Bundle Analysis**: Review code splitting, tree shaking, and load times
- **Caching Strategy**: Evaluate TTS audio cache, Redis usage, and cache invalidation
- **Database Performance**: Assess query efficiency and connection pooling
- **AI Service Optimization**: Review cost controls and rate limiting strategies

### 6. Production Deployment Readiness

- **Build Configuration**: Review Next.js config, optimizations, and environment handling
- **Monitoring**: Assess logging, error tracking, and performance monitoring setup
- **Health Checks**: Validate readiness and liveness probes
- **Rollback Strategy**: Review deployment pipeline and recovery procedures

### 7. Thai Language Specific Analysis

- **Phonetic Accuracy**: Review Thai scoring algorithms and pronunciation analysis
- **Spaced Repetition**: Validate SM-2 implementation and learning effectiveness
- **Smart Coaching**: Assess AI feedback quality and personalization
- **Cultural Localization**: Review Thai language handling and cultural sensitivity

## Review Process

1. **Comprehensive Codebase Analysis**

   - Read all critical files systematically
   - Map data flow and component relationships
   - Identify architectural patterns and anti-patterns

2. **Security Vulnerability Assessment**

   - Check for common OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
   - Review authentication flows and authorization logic
   - Validate input sanitization and output encoding

3. **Performance Profiling**

   - Analyze bundle sizes and loading performance
   - Review database query patterns
   - Assess caching effectiveness

4. **Production Deployment Simulation**
   - Review build process and configuration
   - Validate environment variable management
   - Check monitoring and alerting setup
