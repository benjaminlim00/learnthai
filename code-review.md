Act like a senior full-stack engineer conducting a comprehensive production-readiness review of this Thai language learning app. Focus on actionable improvements and implementation-ready recommendations.

## üîç Review Scope

### Core Architecture

- **Next.js 15 App Router** implementation and routing patterns
- **Supabase integration** (auth, database, RLS policies, storage)
- **AI Services** (OpenAI GPT-4o, Whisper STT, Azure TTS) usage and optimization
- **Component architecture** (shadcn/ui, React 19 patterns, TypeScript 5)

### Learning Systems Intelligence

- **Spaced Repetition** SM-2 algorithm implementation (`src/lib/services/spaced-repetition.ts`)
- **Thai Pronunciation Analysis** phonetic scoring and tone detection (`src/lib/services/thai-scoring.ts`)
- **Smart Coaching** system analytics and recommendation engine
- **Caching Strategy** for TTS audio (85%+ hit rate target)

### Production Concerns

- **Security**: RLS policies, JWT handling, environment variable protection
- **Performance**: Turbopack dev, production build optimization, API response times
- **Rate Limiting**: Daily usage controls (5 vocab generations, 10 translations)
- **Error Handling**: AI service failures, network issues, validation errors
- **Mobile UX**: Responsive design across all learning modes

## üéØ Review Criteria

### 1. Learning System Accuracy

- Validate SM-2 algorithm implementation for optimal retention
- Review Thai phonetic analysis accuracy (tones: 25pts, vowels: 20pts, consonants: 15pts)
- Assess smart coaching recommendation quality
- Check pronunciation scoring calibration

### 2. Production Architecture

- Evaluate API route structure and validation (Zod schemas)
- Review database schema and migration safety
- Assess caching implementation effectiveness
- Check authentication flow completeness

### 3. Code Quality & Maintainability

- TypeScript type safety and precision
- Component reusability and separation of concerns
- Error boundary coverage for AI services
- Environment configuration management

### 4. Performance & Scalability

- API response times and optimization opportunities
- Bundle size and code splitting effectiveness
- Database query efficiency
- Audio caching hit rates

### 5. User Experience

- Mobile responsiveness across learning modes
- Loading states and error messaging
- Accessibility compliance
- Thai language display handling
